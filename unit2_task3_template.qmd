## QUESTION 1

__Calculate the average career length for players who have played at least 10 games in their career. Use years as the unit of measure.__

_This small chart is indicates that On average most players who play 10+ games, is about 5.84 years._

```{python}
query1 = """
SELECT AVG(career_length) AS avg_career_length
FROM (
    SELECT playerID, MAX(yearID) - MIN(yearID) AS career_length
    FROM Batting
    GROUP BY playerID
    HAVING SUM(G) >= 10
);
"""
df1 = pd.read_sql(query1, con)
df1
```


## QUESTION 2

1. Identify the top 10 players with the longest careers (based on the number of years they played). Include their:

    - playerID
    - first_name
    - last_name
    - career_length

_Top 10 players have a massive career length ranging from 27 years (Evers, Jennings, Ryan, & Street) all the way up to Altrock having 35 years worth of playing baseball._

```{python}
query2 = """
SELECT b.playerID, p.nameFirst AS first_name, p.nameLast AS last_name,
       MAX(b.yearID) - MIN(b.yearID) AS career_length
FROM Batting b
JOIN People p ON b.playerID = p.playerID
GROUP BY b.playerID
HAVING SUM(b.G) >= 10
ORDER BY career_length DESC
LIMIT 10;
"""

# Run the query and load results into a DataFrame
df2 = pd.read_sql(query2, con)

# Sort df2 by career_length descending
df2 = df2.sort_values('career_length', ascending=False)

# Convert last_name to categorical with ordering so the plot respects order
df2['last_name'] = pd.Categorical(df2['last_name'], categories=df2['last_name'], ordered=True)

from lets_plot import *

ggplot(df2, aes(x='last_name', y='career_length')) + \
    geom_bar(stat='identity', fill='#4C72B0') + \
    labs(x='Player Last Name', y='Career Length (years)', title='Top 10 Longest MLB Careers') + \
    theme(axis_text_x=element_text(angle=45, hjust=1))
