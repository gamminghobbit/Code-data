## QUESTION 1

__Create 2-3 charts that evaluate the relationships between each of the top 2 or 3 most important variables (as found in Unit 4 Task 2) and the year the home was built.__ Describe what you learn from the charts about how that variable is related to year built.   

_These charts show strong relationships between the most important variables and whether a home was built before 1980:

- Homes built **after 1980** tend to have **larger living areas** on average.
- **Sale price** is higher in newer homes, which may reflect modernization and condition improvements.
- Homes with a `condition_Good` rating are more frequent in **post-1980** homes, suggesting newer construction or renovation._

```{python}
# import your data here using pandas and the URL
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Chart 1: Live Area vs Year Built
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='before1980', y='livearea')
plt.title("Living Area vs Before 1980")
plt.xlabel("Built Before 1980")
plt.ylabel("Living Area (sq ft)")
plt.show()

# Chart 2: Sale Price vs Year Built
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='before1980', y='sprice')
plt.title("Sale Price vs Before 1980")
plt.xlabel("Built Before 1980")
plt.ylabel("Sale Price")
plt.show()

# Chart 3: Condition_Good vs Year Built
sns.barplot(data=df, x='before1980', y='condition_Good')
plt.title("Proportion of Homes with Condition 'Good' by Year Built")
plt.xlabel("Built Before 1980")
plt.ylabel("Proportion with Condition_Good")
plt.show()
```


## QUESTION 2

__Create at least one other chart to examine a variable(s) you thought might be important but apparently was not. The chart should show its relationship to the year built.__ Describe what you learn from the chart about how that variable is related to year built. Explain why you think it was not (very) important in the model.

_We expected the number of stories (`stories`) in a home to help distinguish older vs. newer homes. However, the chart shows that homes from both eras tend to have a similar distribution of stories. There’s no clear trend or separation between groups, which is likely why this feature wasn’t important to the model. The feature doesn't provide enough predictive signal about the home’s age__

```{python}
# Include and execute your code here
# Include and execute your code here
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Stories vs Before 1980
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='before1980', y='stories')
plt.title("Number of Stories vs Before 1980")
plt.xlabel("Built Before 1980")
plt.ylabel("Number of Stories")
plt.show()
```
