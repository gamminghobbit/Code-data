felisha_df.head(4)
```


## QUESTION 2

In this graph it shows the year with the most babies named David, and breaks it down also to show the total across the country and even breaking it down by state in the year of 1955. the total amount of those babies is roughly 64,755 babies.

```{python}
# Q2
david_df = df[df['name'] == 'David']

my_name = 'William'
#used to filter just your name
myname_df = df[df['name'] == my_name]
#Meant to  Group by year and sum Total across all states
myname_grouped = myname_df.groupby('year')['Total'].sum().reset_index()
# meant to Find the year with the highest count
myname_peak = myname_grouped[myname_grouped['Total'] == myname_grouped['Total'].max()]
print(myname_peak)
```



## QUESTION 4

__How many babies are named ‘Oliver’ in the state of Utah for all years?__

```{python}
# Q5
most_recent_year = df['year'].max()

# Filter data for Utah and the most recent year
utah_most_recent = df[(df['year'] == most_recent_year) & (df['UT'] > 0)]

#i'm assuming all female names are ending in 'a':
utah_female_names = utah_most_recent[utah_most_recent['name'].str.endswith('a')]

# Find the most common female name
most_common_name = utah_female_names[['name', 'UT']].groupby('name')['UT'].sum().idxmax()

print("Most common female name in Utah in the most recent year:", most_common_name)

```
